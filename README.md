# Full_stack_elokuvat_Kodarit

A project created for the mini-fullstack course done with Kodarit, creating a web application with JavaScript, HTML and CSS for fetching movie data and adding user reviews. Therefore solutions have been largely provided by the course teacher, Suvi Syrjäläinen, though I've still written in the code step by step and tried it out with my browser.

Currently in place of a proper reviews database is dummy data coded into the application as a table. A database is to be added on a second course on 7th June 2020. I won't alter the main functionalities of the app before completing the second course so that there won't be difficulties doing the assignments. 

Meanwhile I intend to soon do smaller adjustments to e.g. wordings, layout, and content of the dummy data, and possibly to parts of the JavaScript that shouldn't affect the database coding.
